# Configurable Button

Create a `Button` component

1. Button component takes three props:
    - `value` - The text to show for the button
    - `type` - type of element, `button`, `input` or `anchor`
    - `to` - Destination the button will take you to in case the button is of type anchor

1. Depending on the props passed, the `Button` component will render appropriate button

1. Extra Credit: All remaining props that the `Button` component gets, are passed down to the rendered element.
